Climate change is preconditioning large landslides in polar and alpine regions. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat), but none are known from the east coast. In September 2023, we observed an unprecedented global 9-day-long 10.88 mHz (92 s) monochromatic very-long period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. We demonstrate how 25 M m3 of rock detached from a mountain and entered Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200 m high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 5 m high seiche with a frequency similar to the VLP seismic signal, coupling with the solid Earth as surface waves. However, the extremely low attenuation of the seismic signal remains enigmatic. Ongoing warming will increase the societal risk posed by these events.

These results are submitted for publication and are currently in review.
