# An Extraordinary Tsunamigenic Rockslide Into a Greenland Fjord Rang The Earth For 9 Days

Climate change is preconditioning large landslides in polar and alpine regions. Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in West Greenland, but none are known from the East. In September 2023, we observed an unprecedented global 9-day-long 10.88 mHz (92 s) monochromatic very-long period (VLP) seismic signal, originating from East Greenland. We demonstrate how 25 M m3 of rock detached from a mountain and entered Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200 m high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized into a 5 m seiche with a frequency similar to the VLP seismic signal, coupling with the solid Earth as surface waves. However, the extremely low attenuation of the seismic signal remains enigmatic. We suggest that ongoing warming will increase the societal risk posed by these events.
