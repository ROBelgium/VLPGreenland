# An Extraordinary Tsunamigenic Rockslide in Greenland and its Week-Long Global Seismic Signal

In September 2023, we observed an unprecedented 9-day-long 10.88 mHz monochromatic very-long period seismic signal around the globe, originating from East Greenland. Here we show how 25 M m3 of mountain collapsed and entrained more than 2.3 M m3 of glacier, before entering Dickson Fjord, triggering a 200 m high tsunami. Due to the fjordâ€™s geometry, this event presumably induced a low attenuation mega-seiche causing the seismic signal. This yields the first large-scale insights into how water bodies couple substantial energy into the solid Earth. Ongoing climatic warming in cold regions may increase the occurrence of these enigmatic events.

These results were published in ~~REDACTED~~ on XX.XX.XXXX: [doi:XX/XX/XX](#)

## This repository

This repository contains the codes used in our analysis and information required to prepare all figures in the manuscript and supplementary material. With this we make our findings approachable and fully reproducible.

The repository follows the structure of the manuscript, where codes and/or instructions and data sources are provided for each figure and its subplots:

`fig1\`: Seismic source, tsunami observations and modeling.

`fig2\`: Landslide observations

`fig3\`: Landslide seismic signal and modelling

`fig4\`: Very-Long-Period (VLP) characteristics

`supplementary\`: Figures in the supplementary materials.
