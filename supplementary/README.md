`figS7`: Tidal signal at Dickson Fjord and Ella Ã˜

`figS9-10`: Infrasound array processing and modelling

`figS11-13`: HySEA tsunami simulation

`figS14-18`: VLP seismic signal amplitude decay and frequency variation

`figS19-21`: Polarisation analysis of VLP ground motion

`figS22-28`: Seismic radiation pattern force sketches and simulations
