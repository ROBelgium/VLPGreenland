# Figure 3B-E: Landslide force history

This Python notebook contains the code used to calculate the landslide force history by seismic wave inversion, and is a modified version of the notebook proposed by Allstadt, K. E., Toney, L., & Collins, E. A. (2023) in lsforce (Version 1.1) [Source code]. U.S. Geological Survey Software Release. [https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CR20KW](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9CR20KW)

Also used to compute the trajectory from inverted data plotted in Fig3A.
