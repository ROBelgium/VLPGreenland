# Figure 3: Landslide seismic signal and modelling

![Fig3](f3.png)

This folder contains the information required to reproduce Figure 3 in the manuscript.

`B-E\`: Landslide force history from inversion

`F\`: Landslide trajectory from numerical model

`G\`: Infrasound beam

The landslide trajectories in Fig3A can be found in `B-E\` (landslide force history from inversion) and `F\` (landslide trajectory from numerical model).
