This folder contains the information required to reproduce Figure 5 in the manuscript.

`A\`: Locations of seismic stations with high-fidelity three-component VLP recordings, colored by dominant surface wave type

`B\`: Seiche simulation, showing Love and Rayleigh Nodes

`C\`: Waveform recording from station II.BFO in Germany (29° away), showing dominant Rayleigh energy on the vertical and radial components, with weaker Love energy on the transverse. Indicative Q-values (black lines) highlight their slow, non-exponential decay. S-body waves arriving at 12:46 UTC (inset) carry the initial VLP signal. Synthetic seismogram envelopes (red lines) using the simulated seiche signal at the location of the landslide (Fig. 4E), scaled to a maximum horizontal force of 5×1011 N (29), match the maximum VLP amplitudes and their decay. All signals are 10-12 mHz bandpass filtered.

`D\`: Vertical-component spectrogram from DK.SCO (2.6° away), showing the >9 day-long duration of the VLP signal (white arrow).

`E\`: Amplitude spectrum of the simulated seiche time series at the landslide impact in the fjord
