# Figure 2G: Landslide estimation from photogrammetry

Agisoft Metashape processing reports provide all of the parameters, the system information, and the software version used in Structure from Motion processing, as well as an overview of the survey geometry, ground control points, location errors, and model resolution.

`report_glacier_change_coregistration.pdf`: This report contains information about the point matching and bundle adjustment procedure for the combined dataset of pre-evant and post-event photographs. This is the initial processing step for the calculation of glacier surface change.

`report_glacier_change_before.pdf`: This report contains information about dense cloud construction using the pre-event photographs

`report_glacier_change_after.pdf`: This report contains information about dense cloud construction using the post-event photographs

`report_landslide.pdf`: This report contains information about the point matching, bundle adjustment, dense cloud construction, and DEM and orthoimage generation for the model used for the landslide volume calculation.
