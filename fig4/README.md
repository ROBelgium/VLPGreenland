<img align="left" src="fig4.png" width="400px">

This folder contains the information required to reproduce Figure 4 in the manuscript.

`B\`: Tsunami propagation model

`C\`: Ella Ã˜ tide gauge and simulations

`D\`: Comparison between observed (15-min sampling interval) and simulated (using the HySEA tsunami model) water level at the Dickson Fjord tide gauge/CTD station

`E\`: Filtered (9-13 mHz bandpass) simulated long term tsunami water elevation at the landslide fjord impact location, with indicative exponential decay-rates labelled as Q-values

Subplot B contains runups estimated from manual interpretation of Sentinel 2 satellite images ([sentinel-hub.com](https://sentinel-hub.com)).
