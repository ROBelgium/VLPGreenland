# Detailed Bathymetry of the Kempe Fjord area, including Dickson Fjord

`Bathy_Kempefjord_15m.tif.zip` contains the (compressed) detailed bathymetry of the Kempe Fjord area, including Dickson Fjord in GeoTiff format. Uncompressed size is 226MB.

The 15 m bathymetrical data for Dickson Fjord were surveyed in the summer of 2018 by the national Danish Hydrographic Office for the production of nautical charts. The data has not been previously published. Due to the previously uncharted nature of the fjord system the survey vessel could not go too close to the shore leaving a 150 to 300 m wide and circa 200 m deep coastal gap where no data is available.

We acknowledge the Danish Hydrographic Office for making this data publicly available.
